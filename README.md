Based on an existing instrument Thermine, it includes pulsing lights and white noise that reacts to the pitch based on the hand position between the instrument and the user. If the rate of the distances changes quickly, it becomes more chaotic. The goal in mind for this device is to slowly move or be still onf the hand movement detected by the instrument.
